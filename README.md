# volunteer
A full-stack Philadelphia Volunteer app matching organizations to volunteers.  Designed using MVC (model view controller) pattern for efficient code reuse.

The app opens to the sign-in section of the home page. 

New users can fill out a form to join Philadelphia Volunteer.  In this form, there is also survey to track any special skills needed for the volunteer opportunity, number of hours, date, time, etc.  This way the app can suggest matches between organizations and volunteers.

After joining or logging in, the user is taken to an opportunity portion of the home page.  The top 6 matched  opportunities are listed.  The user can add an opportunity, see their profile, click a button to see more opportunities, change the search criteria to see different matched opportunities or see all opportunities. 

By clicking on add opportunity, the member is directed to an add opportunity form.

If the member clicks on the member profile, they are shown their personal data, opportunity participation and any opportunities they have posted. 

If the member chooses an opportunity to participate in, they can click on the opportunity thumbnail.  The app will then take the user to a form to to sign-up for the opportunity.

After completing any form, the member is redirected to the opportunities portion of the home page.

mySQL database is used to keep track of all members and opportunities.
