# volunteer
A full-stack Philadelphia Volunteer app matching organizations to volunteers.  Designed using MVC (model view controller) pattern for efficient code reuse.

The app opens to the sign-in section of the home page. 

New users can fill out a form to join Philadelphia Volunteer.  In this form, there is also survey to track any special skills needed for the volunteer opportunity, number of hours, date, time, etc.  This way the app can suggest matches between organizations and volunteers.

After joining or logging in, the user is taken to an events portion of the home page.  The top 6 matched  events are listed.  The user can add an event, see their profile, click a button to see more events, change the search criteria to see different matched events or see all events. 

By clicking on add event, the member is directed to an add event form.

If the member clicks on the member profile, they are shown their personal data, event participation and any events they have posted. 

If the member chooses an event to participate in, they can click on the event thumbnail.  The app will then take the user to a form to to sign-up for the event.

After completing any form, the member is redirected to the events portion of the home page.

mySQL database is used to keep track of all members and events.
